# I love Shiya: The Analytical Romance

Let's look at the types of diamonds I can waste money on. First, we'll load the
data.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

head(diamonds)
```

Now we want to see just how much money we can waste. We'll look at the average
price according to the cut.

```{r}
graph_data <- diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarize(ave_price = mean(price))

graph_data

g <- ggplot(data = graph_data, aes(x = cut, y = ave_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

g
```

Wow! That's a lot of money!
